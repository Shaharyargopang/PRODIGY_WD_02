I've built a stopwatch web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures elements, CSS styles them, and JavaScript adds functionality like starting, pausing, resetting the stopwatch, and tracking lap times. The result n interactive and user-friendly stopwatch tool for accurate time measurement and recording.
